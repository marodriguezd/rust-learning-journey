# My Rust Learning Repository

This repository is meant for my personal learning of the Rust programming language using the official documentation and other learning resources. I will be uploading my code, notes, and any other advancements as I progress through my learning journey.

## Motivation

I created this repository to document my progress and to keep track of the code and projects I work on while learning Rust. By maintaining this repository, I aim to create a portfolio of my work and to have a reference for future learning and projects.

## Resources

- [Official Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Structure

- `/code`: This directory will contain the code examples, projects, and exercises I work on while learning Rust.
- `/notes`: I will keep my learning notes, summaries, and any other relevant documentation here.

## Progress

I will regularly update this README and the repository with my progress, code, and any other relevant information related to my learning journey.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily for my personal learning, I welcome constructive feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community.
