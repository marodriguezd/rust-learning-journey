## Installation
- [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/): The Rust installer and version management tool
  - For Windows users, download the installer and follow the onscreen instructions: [Download](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe).
  - I'm going to use Rustrover as editor: [Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/). And install Rust using the installer inside Rustrover.
- Keep Rust up to date by running `rustup update`

## Tools
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/): The Rust build tool and package manager
  - Use Cargo to build, run, test, and document your projects
  - Check if Cargo is installed by running `cargo --version`
- Rust support is available in many editors including VS Code, Sublime Text, Vim, and more

## Getting Started
- Use Cargo to create a new project: `cargo new hello-rust`
  - This creates a new directory with a `Cargo.toml` manifest file and a `src/main.rs` file for your application code
- Run your program with `cargo run`

## Adding Dependencies
- Use crates.io, the package registry for Rust, to find and add dependencies
- Update your `Cargo.toml` file with the dependency information
- Run `cargo build` to install the dependency

## A Small Rust Application
- Write a small application using a dependency
- Run your application with `cargo run`
