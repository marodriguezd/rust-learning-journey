# Error Handling

Errors are inevitable in software development, so Rust offers features to manage them effectively. Rust enforces error handling at compile time, ensuring robust code that addresses errors before deployment.

Rust categorizes errors into two types: recoverable and unrecoverable. Recoverable errors, like "file not found," can be managed and retried. Unrecoverable errors, such as out-of-bounds access, indicate bugs and require program termination.

Rust uses `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and the `panic!` macro for unrecoverable errors. This chapter explores using `panic!` first, then `Result<T, E>`, and provides guidelines on when to attempt error recovery or stop execution.
