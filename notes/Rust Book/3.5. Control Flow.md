# Control Flow in Rust

Control flow constructs in Rust, such as `if` expressions and loops, are essential for directing the execution flow of a program based on conditions and for repeating code execution.

## `if` Expressions
- Enable code branching based on conditions.
- Syntax: `if condition { // code } else { // code }`.
- Conditions must be boolean expressions (`bool`).

### Example
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;
    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

## Handling Multiple Conditions
- Use `else if` to handle multiple conditions in an `if` expression.

### Example
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } // More conditions can follow
}
```

## Using `if` in `let` Statements
- `if` can be used in a `let` statement to assign values based on a condition.

### Example
```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

## Loops
Rust provides various loops for repeating code: `loop`, `while`, and `for`.

### Infinite Loops with `loop`
- Use `loop` for infinite loops, breakable with `break`.
```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

### Conditional Loops with `while`
- Use `while` for loops that run based on a condition.
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");
        number -= 1;
    }
}
```

### Iterating with `for`
- Use `for` for iterating over elements in a collection like an array.
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

## Summary
This chapter covered foundational concepts of control flow in Rust, including conditional branching with `if` expressions and various looping mechanisms for iterative operations. Understanding these constructs is crucial for creating dynamic and responsive Rust programs.
