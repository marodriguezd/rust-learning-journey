# Common Collections

Rust’s standard library includes several useful data structures called collections. Unlike other data types that represent a single value, collections can contain multiple values. Collections store data on the heap, allowing dynamic resizing during runtime. Each collection type has different capabilities and trade-offs, and choosing the appropriate one is a skill you’ll develop over time. This chapter covers three commonly used collections in Rust:

- **Vector**: Stores a variable number of values next to each other.
- **String**: A collection of characters. We’ll discuss the `String` type in depth.
- **Hash Map**: Associates a value with a particular key, implementing the map data structure.

To learn about other collections provided by the standard library, see the documentation.

## Overview

We'll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, and highlight what makes each special.
