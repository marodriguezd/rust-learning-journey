# Using Structs to Structure Related Data in Rust

Structs in Rust are custom data types that allow you to bundle together related values into a meaningful group. Similar to objects in object-oriented languages, structs enable you to encapsulate attributes of something into a single, cohesive unit.

## Key Concepts of Structs

- **Custom Data Types:** Structs let you define a data type that combines different pieces of data.
- **Named Fields:** Unlike tuples, each piece of data in a struct has a name, making your code more readable and expressive.

## Defining and Instantiating Structs

To define a struct, you specify the name and the fields it will contain. Instantiating a struct involves specifying concrete values for each of its fields.

### Example Definition and Instantiation

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

let user1 = User {
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

## Associated Functions and Methods

- **Associated Functions:** Functions that are associated with the struct, but don't take `self` as a parameter. Often used for constructors.
- **Methods:** Functions that are associated with an instance of the struct and take `self` as a parameter, allowing them to modify or utilize the instance's data.

### Example Method Definition and Use

```rust
impl User {
    fn get_email(&self) -> &str {
        &self.email
    }
}

let user_email = user1.get_email();
```

## Structs vs Tuples

While tuples are useful for grouping together items of different types, structs provide more clarity by allowing you to name each element. This makes your code more self-documenting and easier to work with.

## Summary

Structs are a foundational feature in Rust for organizing related data. By combining different pieces of data under a single name and defining behavior through associated functions and methods, structs empower you to create more readable, maintainable, and type-safe code.
