# Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

Strings in Rust are complex due to error handling, the underlying data structure, and UTF-8 encoding. Strings are collections of bytes with additional methods to interpret these bytes as text. This section covers String operations like creating, updating, and reading, and how String differs from other collections.

## What Is a String?

Rust has one core string type: `str`, usually seen as `&str`, a borrowed string slice. The `String` type, provided by the standard library, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string. Both `String` and `&str` are UTF-8 encoded and used extensively.

## Creating a New String

Strings can be created similarly to `Vec<T>`, as `String` is a wrapper around a vector of bytes.

```rust
let mut s = String::new(); // Creating a new, empty String
```

You can also use the `to_string` method or `String::from` to create a String from a string literal.

```rust
let data = "initial contents";
let s = data.to_string(); // Using to_string
let s = String::from("initial contents"); // Using String::from
```

Strings support UTF-8, allowing for multilingual data.

```rust
let hello = String::from("こんにちは"); // Storing "Hello" in Japanese
```

## Updating a String

Strings can grow and change. Use `push_str` to append a string slice and `push` to add a single character.

```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar"); // Appending a string slice
s.push('!'); // Adding a single character
```

### Concatenation with the + Operator or format! Macro

You can concatenate strings using the `+` operator or `format!` macro.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // s1 is moved and can no longer be used

let s = format!("{s1}-{s2}-{s3}"); // Using format! macro for clarity
```

## Indexing into Strings

Indexing into strings is not allowed in Rust due to UTF-8 encoding complexities.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
// let h = s1[0]; // This will cause an error
```

## Internal Representation

Strings are stored as `Vec<u8>`, and each character can occupy multiple bytes. Indexing operations in strings are not constant time (O(1)), so slicing must be done with caution.

## Methods for Iterating Over Strings

Use the `chars` method for individual Unicode scalar values and `bytes` for raw bytes.

```rust
for c in "Зд".chars() {
    println!("{c}"); // Prints Unicode scalar values
}

for b in "Зд".bytes() {
    println!("{b}"); // Prints raw bytes
}
```

## Summary

Strings in Rust are intricate due to UTF-8 encoding and Rust's emphasis on safety. Rust provides various methods to handle string data correctly, helping you manage the complexity upfront. For more functions, check the standard library documentation.
