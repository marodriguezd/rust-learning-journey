# Summary of Common Programming Concepts in Rust

This section explores foundational programming concepts that are universal across programming languages, with a specific focus on their implementation and use in Rust. It serves as an introduction to:

- **Variables**: How to declare and use variables in Rust.
- **Basic Types**: Understanding the basic data types available in Rust.
- **Functions**: The syntax and structure of functions in Rust.
- **Comments**: How to write comments in Rust code for better readability and maintenance.
- **Control Flow**: An overview of control structures like loops and conditional statements in Rust.

The chapter also highlights the significance of **Rust's keywords**, which are reserved for specific tasks within the language and cannot be used as identifiers for variables or functions. These keywords are pivotal in performing various operations in Rust and some are reserved for potential future features.

This foundational knowledge equips learners with a solid base, essential for advancing in Rust programming.
