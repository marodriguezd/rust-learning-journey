# Summary of Data Types in Rust

Rust is a statically typed language, necessitating the knowledge of variable types at compile time, yet it often infers types from usage. This summary covers the essentials of scalar and compound types in Rust.

## Scalar Types
- **Integers**: Various lengths and signed/unsigned variants (e.g., i32, u8). Rust defaults to `i32` for integers.
- **Floating-Point Numbers**: `f64` (double precision, default) and `f32` (single precision). Used for values with decimal points.
- **Booleans**: The `bool` type, holding `true` or `false`.
- **Characters**: `char` type, representing a Unicode Scalar Value, allowing for more than just ASCII.

## Compound Types
- **Tuples**: Group different types into one compound type with a fixed length. Elements can be accessed by index or destructured.
- **Arrays**: Contain multiple values of the same type with a fixed length. Useful for data allocated on the stack or when the number of elements is constant.

### Type Annotations and Overflow
Explicit type annotations are needed when multiple types could apply, especially with numeric operations. Rust checks for integer overflow at runtime in debug mode, leading to a panic, but wraps in release mode.

### Shadowing vs Mutability
Shadowing allows redeclaration of a variable name with a potential type change, different from using `mut`, which requires the same type for reassignments.

This summary encapsulates Rust's approach to data types, emphasizing the language's type safety and versatility in handling various data representations.
