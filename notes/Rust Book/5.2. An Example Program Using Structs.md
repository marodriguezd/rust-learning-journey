# An Example Program Using Structs

This example program demonstrates how to use structs in Rust to calculate the area of a rectangle, starting from using individual variables and refactoring towards using structs to improve clarity and organization of the code.

## Initial Approach with Separate Variables

Initially, the program calculates the area of a rectangle using separate variables for width and height:

```rust
fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!("The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.", area(width1, height1));
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
    width * height
}
```

## Refactoring with Tuples

Then, the code is refactored to use a tuple to group width and height, reducing the number of arguments passed to the `area` function:

```rust
fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!("The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.", area(rect1));
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}
```

However, this version loses clarity as tuples do not name their elements.

## Refactoring with Structs for Clarity

To improve clarity and expressiveness, the program is refactored again to use a `Rectangle` struct, which explicitly names `width` and `height`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!("The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.", area(&rect1));
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
```

This version of the program is clearer and maintains the relationship between the width and height of the rectangle.

## Adding Debugging Capabilities

To facilitate debugging, the `Debug` trait is derived for `Rectangle`, allowing the instances of `Rectangle` to be printed for debugging purposes:

```rust
println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
```

This shows how structs in Rust can group related data and associate specific functionalities, like area calculation, enhancing code clarity and maintainability.
