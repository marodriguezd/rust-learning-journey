### Enums and Pattern Matching

This chapter explores enumerations (enums), which allow defining a type by enumerating its possible variants. We start by defining and using an enum to illustrate how enums can encapsulate meaning along with data. We then delve into the `Option` enum, which represents a value that could be either something or nothing. Additionally, we discuss how pattern matching with the `match` expression simplifies executing different code for different enum values. Lastly, we examine the `if let` construct, a convenient and concise way to handle enums in Rust.
