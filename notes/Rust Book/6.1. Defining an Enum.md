# Defining an Enum in Rust

Enums in Rust allow you to define a type by listing its possible variants. This chapter introduces enums, showcasing how they provide a way to group multiple possibilities into a single data type.

## Understanding Enums

Enums are essential for cases where a value can be one of several types. For example, an IP address can either be version four or version six.

### Enums vs. Structs

While structs group related data of various types, enums allow for setting a value among multiple predefined variants. They're particularly useful when you need to ensure that a value can only be one of several predefined options.

### Declaring an Enum

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

## Utilizing Enums with Structs

Enums can be integrated within structs to provide a clear definition of variant-based data handling.

### Example of Enum and Struct Integration

```rust
struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};
```

## Enhancing Enums with Data Directly

Enums can also directly hold data, eliminating the need for extra structs, which simplifies data structures.

### Example of Enums Holding Data

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
```

## Dynamic Data Handling with Enums

Enums support variants with different types and amounts of associated data, which enhances flexibility in handling data dynamically.

### Example of Dynamic Data Handling

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}
```

## Summary

This chapter explores how enums provide a robust framework for handling a set of predefined options in Rust, ensuring type safety and clear data handling rules. Enums are versatile, allowing for direct data storage or integration within other data structures like structs.
