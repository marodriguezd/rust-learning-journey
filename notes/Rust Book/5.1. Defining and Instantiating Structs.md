# Defining and Instantiating Structs in Rust

Structs in Rust allow you to package together related values of possibly different types into a single, cohesive unit. They are similar to tuples but provide the added benefit of naming each piece of data, making your code more descriptive and flexible.

## Defining Structs

To define a struct, use the `struct` keyword followed by the name of the struct. Inside curly brackets, list the fields with their names and types.

### Example

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

## Instantiating Structs

Create an instance of a struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields within curly brackets. Field names and values are separated by colons.

### Example

```rust
let user1 = User {
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

## Accessing and Modifying Struct Fields

Use dot notation to access or modify a struct's fields. For modification, the instance must be mutable.

### Example

```rust
let mut user1 = User {
    // fields initialization
};

user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
```

## Struct Update Syntax

Rust provides a convenient syntax to create a new instance of a struct using some of the values from another instance.

### Example

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    ..user1
};
```

## Tuple Structs

Tuple structs are like tuples but each instance is a different type, providing the benefits of struct naming.

### Example

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

## Unit-Like Structs

Unit-like structs have no fields and are useful for implementing traits on types without data.

### Example

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

let subject = AlwaysEqual;
```

## Ownership of Struct Data

Rust allows structs to own their data fully (using types like `String`) or borrow data (using references like `&str`), though borrowing requires specifying lifetimes to ensure the data remains valid.
