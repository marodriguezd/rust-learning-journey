# Getting Started with Rust

## Introduction

Let’s start your Rust journey! In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

- Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Writing a program that prints Hello, world!
- Using cargo, Rust’s package manager and build system

## Installation

The first step is to install Rust. We’ll download Rust through rustup, a command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler. 

### Installing rustup on Linux or macOS

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

### Installing rustup on Windows

On Windows, go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and follow the instructions for installing Rust. 

### Troubleshooting

To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter this line:

```bash
$ rustc --version
```

### Updating and Uninstalling

Once Rust is installed via rustup, updating to a newly released version is easy. To uninstall Rust and rustup, run the following uninstall script from your shell:

```bash
$ rustup self uninstall
```

### Local Documentation

The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so that you can read it offline. Run `rustup doc` to open the local documentation in your browser.

## Hello, World!

Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program. Let’s write a program that prints the text Hello, world! to the screen.

## Anatomy of a Rust Program

Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of the puzzle:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps

Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by entering the rustc command and passing it the name of your source file.

## Hello, Cargo!

Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.

### Creating a Project with Cargo

Let’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our original “Hello, world!” project. 

### Building and Running a Cargo Project

Now let’s look at what’s different when we build and run the “Hello, world!” program with Cargo! From your hello_cargo directory, build your project by entering the following command:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

### Building for Release

When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build --release` to compile it with optimizations.

### Cargo as Convention

With simple projects, Cargo doesn’t provide a lot of value over just using rustc, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate.

## Summary

You’re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you’ve learned how to:

- Install the latest stable version of Rust using rustup
- Update to a newer Rust version
- Open locally installed documentation
- Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using rustc directly
- Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo

This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading and writing Rust code. So, in Chapter 2, we’ll build a guessing game program. If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in Rust, see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.
