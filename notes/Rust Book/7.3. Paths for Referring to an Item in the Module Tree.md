# Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path similar to navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to know its path.

## Types of Paths

- **Absolute Path**: Starts from the crate root. For external crates, it begins with the crate name; for the current crate, it starts with `crate`.
- **Relative Path**: Starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module.

Both path types use double colons (`::`) to separate identifiers.

## Example: Calling a Function

To call the `add_to_waitlist` function from the crate root in `eat_at_restaurant`:

### Absolute Path

```rust
crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
```

### Relative Path

```rust
front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
```

Absolute paths start from the crate root, similar to `/` in a filesystem. Relative paths start from the current module.

## Choosing Path Types

Choose between relative and absolute paths based on your project structure. Absolute paths are useful when you might move definitions independently of calls, while relative paths are useful when you move related items together.

## Handling Privacy with `pub`

By default, items in Rust are private. To make the `hosting` module and `add_to_waitlist` function accessible from `eat_at_restaurant`, use the `pub` keyword.

### Making a Module Public

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}
```

### Making a Function Public

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}
```

## Summary

Paths in Rust help locate items within the module tree using absolute or relative references. The `pub` keyword manages item visibility, making modules and functions accessible as needed. Understanding these concepts is crucial for organizing and accessing code in Rust projects.
