# The match Control Flow Construct

Rust has a powerful control flow construct called `match` that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches. This construct is highly expressive and ensures all possible cases are handled by the compiler.

## Understanding match

The `match` expression in Rust is similar to a coin-sorting machine, where values go through each pattern and execute the associated code block once a match is found.

### Example of match with Enums

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

### Example with Curly Brackets

For longer code blocks within match arms, curly brackets are used:

```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => {
            println!("Lucky penny!");
            1
        }
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

## Patterns That Bind to Values

Patterns in match arms can bind to parts of the values, allowing extraction of data from enum variants.

### Example with Data Binding

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        }
    }
}
```

## Matching with Option<T>

`match` can handle `Option<T>` similarly to enums.

### Example with Option<T>

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
```

### Exhaustive Matching

All possible patterns must be covered in a `match` expression.

### Example of Non-exhaustive match (Does not compile)

```rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}
```

## Catch-all Patterns and the _ Placeholder

Catch-all patterns handle all values not specifically listed. The `_` pattern matches any value and does not bind to it.

### Example with Catch-all Patterns

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    _ => reroll(),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn reroll() {}
```

## Summary

The `match` control flow construct in Rust is a versatile and powerful tool for handling various patterns, ensuring exhaustive matching, and providing clear and safe data handling.
