# Bringing Paths into Scope with the use Keyword

Writing out full paths to call functions can be repetitive. The `use` keyword allows creating shortcuts to simplify this process.

## Example with use

In Listing 7-11, we bring the `crate::front_of_house::hosting` module into the scope of the `eat_at_restaurant` function:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

## Scope of use

The `use` keyword creates shortcuts only within the scope it's used. In Listing 7-12, moving `eat_at_restaurant` to a child module requires moving the `use` statement as well:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
}
```

### Compiler Error

The compiler error shows that the shortcut no longer applies within the `customer` module:

```sh
error[E0433]: failed to resolve: use of undeclared crate or module `hosting`
```

## Idiomatic use Paths

Bringing a function's parent module into scope with `use` is idiomatic, as shown in Listing 7-11:

```rust
use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

In contrast, Listing 7-13 shows an unidiomatic way:

```rust
use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    add_to_waitlist();
}
```

### Idiomatic Example with Structs

For structs, enums, and other items, itâ€™s idiomatic to specify the full path:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}
```

## Handling Name Conflicts with as

When bringing in items with the same name, use the `as` keyword to create an alias:

```rust
use std::fmt::Result;
use std::io::Result as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}
```

## Re-exporting with pub use

Combine `pub` and `use` to re-export items:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

## Using External Packages

To use an external package, add it to `Cargo.toml` and bring items into scope with `use`:

```toml
rand = "0.8.5"
```

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
}
```

## Nested Paths and the Glob Operator

### Nested Paths

Combine paths to reduce the number of `use` statements:

```rust
use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
```

### Glob Operator

Use the glob operator to bring all public items into scope:

```rust
use std::collections::*;
```

Be cautious with the glob operator as it can make it harder to track what names are in scope.
