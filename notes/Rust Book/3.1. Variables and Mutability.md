# Summary of Variables and Mutability in Rust

This section discusses Rust's approach to variables and mutability, emphasizing the language's preference for immutability to leverage safety and concurrency benefits. Key points include:

## Variables and Immunity
- By default, variables in Rust are immutable.
- Immutability aids in maintaining the integrity of values throughout the program's execution, reducing bugs.
- An example demonstrates the compiler error when attempting to reassign an immutable variable.

## Introducing Mutability
- Mutability can be opted-in by using the `mut` keyword, allowing variable values to be altered.
- This flexibility is balanced with Rust's encouragement for immutability, where practical.

## Constants
- Constants in Rust are always immutable and declared using the `const` keyword, requiring type annotation.
- They differ from variables in their immutability, scope, and initialization constraints.

## Shadowing
- Rust allows shadowing, enabling the declaration of a new variable with the same name as a previous variable within a new scope.
- This feature is useful for transforming a value while keeping the variable immutable after the transformation.

Examples and compiler error messages are provided to illustrate these concepts, helping to clarify the use and behavior of variables, mutability, constants, and shadowing in Rust.
