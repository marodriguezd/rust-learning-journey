# Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

The first collection type we’ll look at is `Vec<T>`, also known as a vector. Vectors store multiple values of the same type next to each other in memory. They are useful for lists of items, such as lines of text in a file or prices in a shopping cart.

## Creating a New Vector

To create a new empty vector:

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

To create a vector with initial values:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

## Updating a Vector

To add elements to a vector, use the `push` method:

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();
v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
```

## Reading Elements of Vectors

To reference a value stored in a vector, use indexing or the `get` method:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let third: &i32 = &v[2];
let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
```

## Handling Out-of-Bounds Access

Accessing an out-of-bounds index with `[]` causes a panic, while `get` returns `None`:

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let does_not_exist = &v[100]; // Panics
let does_not_exist = v.get(100); // Returns None
```

## Borrow Checker Rules

The borrow checker enforces rules to ensure references to vector elements remain valid:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = &v[0];
v.push(6); // Error: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
```

## Iterating over Values

To iterate over a vector's elements:

```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
    println!("{i}");
}
```

To mutate elements while iterating:

```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
    *i += 50;
}
```

## Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

Vectors can store elements of different types using an enum:

```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
    Int(i32),
    Float(f64),
    Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
    SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
    SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
    SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```

## Dropping a Vector

When a vector goes out of scope, its elements are dropped:

```rust
{
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    // do stuff with v
} // v goes out of scope and is freed here
```

Next, we’ll discuss the `String` type in depth.
