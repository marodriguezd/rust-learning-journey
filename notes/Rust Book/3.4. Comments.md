# Comments in Rust

Comments are crucial for making source code more understandable. In Rust, comments are ignored by the compiler but can provide valuable context and explanations for developers.

## Single-Line Comments
- Use two slashes `//` to start a comment.
- The comment continues until the end of the line.
- For multi-line comments, prepend `//` to each line.

## Examples
```rust
// This is a single-line comment.

// For multi-line comments,
// use `//` on each line.
```

## Inline Comments
- Comments can also be placed at the end of a line of code, though they are typically used above the code they describe.

```rust
fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // Inline comment
}
```

## Above Code
- It's common to place comments on a separate line above the code they annotate for clarity.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Declaring a variable with an initial lucky number
    let lucky_number = 7;
}
```

## Documentation Comments
- Rust also supports documentation comments, used for generating documentation. These will be covered in detail in Chapter 14.

Comments enhance code readability and maintenance, providing insight into code functionality and developer intent.
