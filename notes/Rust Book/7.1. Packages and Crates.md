# Packages and Crates

The first parts of the module system weâ€™ll cover are packages and crates.

## What is a Crate?

A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a time. Even if you run `rustc` with a single source code file, the compiler treats that file as a crate. Crates can contain modules, which may be defined in other files.

### Types of Crates

- **Binary Crates**: Programs that compile to an executable and must have a `main` function. Examples include command-line programs and servers.
- **Library Crates**: Do not have a `main` function and are meant to be shared across projects. They provide functionality, like the `rand` crate for random number generation.

## Crate Root

The crate root is the source file from which the Rust compiler starts. It forms the root module of your crate.

## What is a Package?

A package is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of functionality. It contains a `Cargo.toml` file that describes how to build those crates. 

### Package Details

- A package can contain multiple binary crates but only one library crate.
- A package must contain at least one crate, either a library or a binary crate.

## Creating a Package

When you create a package with `cargo new`, Cargo sets up the directory structure and files for you.

```sh
$ cargo new my-project
     Created binary (application) `my-project` package
$ ls my-project
Cargo.toml
src
$ ls my-project/src
main.rs
```

- `Cargo.toml`: Describes the package.
- `src/main.rs`: The crate root for a binary crate named `my-project`.

If the package directory contains `src/lib.rs`, it indicates a library crate with the same name as the package.

### Example Structure

A package can contain:
- `src/main.rs` for a binary crate.
- `src/lib.rs` for a library crate.
- `src/bin/` for additional binary crates.

## Summary

Packages and crates are fundamental to organizing and managing Rust projects. They allow you to build, test, and share code efficiently using Cargo. Understanding the structure and purpose of packages and crates is essential for developing robust and maintainable Rust applications.
