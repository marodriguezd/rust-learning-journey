# Separating Modules into Different Files

When modules become large, it's helpful to move their definitions to separate files for easier navigation.

## Example: Extracting Modules into Files

Starting from Listing 7-17, we will extract modules into files instead of having them all in the crate root file (`src/lib.rs`).

### Step 1: Extract front_of_house Module

Remove the code inside the curly brackets for the `front_of_house` module, leaving only the `mod front_of_house;` declaration:

```rust
// Filename: src/lib.rs
// This code does not compile!
mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Place the code that was inside the curly brackets into a new file named `src/front_of_house.rs`:

```rust
// Filename: src/front_of_house.rs
pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
```

### Step 2: Extract hosting Module

Change `src/front_of_house.rs` to contain only the declaration of the `hosting` module:

```rust
// Filename: src/front_of_house.rs
pub mod hosting;
```

Create a `src/front_of_house` directory and move the `hosting` module definitions into `src/front_of_house/hosting.rs`:

```rust
// Filename: src/front_of_house/hosting.rs
pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
```

### Compiler Rules for Module Files

The compiler knows to look for module code based on the module declaration's location. Ensure file paths match the module tree structure.

## Alternate File Paths

Rust supports two styles for module file paths:

- `src/front_of_house.rs` (current style)
- `src/front_of_house/mod.rs` (older style, still supported)

Ensure not to mix both styles for the same module to avoid compiler errors.

## Summary

Rust allows splitting a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules for better code organization. Modules can be referred to using absolute or relative paths and brought into scope with `use` statements. Module code is private by default, but you can make it public with the `pub` keyword. 

In the next chapter, we'll explore collection data structures in the standard library to use in your organized code.
