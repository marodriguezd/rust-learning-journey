# Programming a Guessing Game

In this project, we'll create a guessing game to introduce several Rust concepts, including `let`, `match`, methods, associated functions, and external crates.

## Overview

The guessing game generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the player to guess it. The program indicates whether each guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game ends with a congratulatory message.

## Setting Up

Create a new project with Cargo:

```bash
$ cargo new guessing_game
$ cd guessing_game
```

## Processing a Guess

Modify `src/main.rs` to ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");
    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
}
```

## Generating a Secret Number

Add the `rand` crate to `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
rand = "0.8.5"
```

Update `src/main.rs` to generate a random number:

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    // --snip--
}
```

## Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number

Handle comparing the user's guess to the secret number:

```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
```

## Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping

Introduce looping to allow multiple guesses:

```rust
fn main() {
    // --snip--
    loop {
        // --snip--
    }
}
```

## Handling Invalid Input

Modify the program to handle non-numeric input gracefully, allowing the user to continue guessing:

```rust
fn main() {
    // --snip--
    let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
        Ok(num) => num,
        Err(_) => continue,
    };
    // --snip--
}
```

## Summary

This project introduced basic Rust programming concepts through building a simple guessing game. The game takes user input, generates a random number, and compares the input to the number, providing feedback and allowing for multiple attempts.

The project demonstrates the use of `let`, `match`, external crates (`rand`), and control flow in Rust.
