# To panic! or Not to panic!

When deciding whether to call `panic!` or return `Result`, consider the impact of each choice. Calling `panic!` stops the program and there's no way to recover, whereas returning a `Result` gives the calling code options to handle the error appropriately.

In examples, prototypes, and tests, it’s often more appropriate to write code that panics. These situations are generally understood to include placeholders for more robust error handling.

## Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests

Including robust error-handling code in examples can obscure the primary point. Using methods like `unwrap` or `expect` is acceptable as placeholders, and these methods are handy during prototyping before finalizing error handling. In tests, if a method call fails, the test should fail, and calling `unwrap` or `expect` is appropriate.

## Cases in Which You Have More Information Than the Compiler

It's appropriate to call `unwrap` or `expect` when you have logic that ensures a `Result` will have an `Ok` value, but the compiler can’t understand it. Documenting the reason for using `expect` helps ensure that if the assumptions change, the error handling can be updated accordingly.

Example:
```rust
use std::net::IpAddr;

let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1"
    .parse()
    .expect("Hardcoded IP address should be valid");
```

## Guidelines for Error Handling

Your code should panic in situations where it could end up in a bad state. A bad state is when assumptions, guarantees, or invariants are broken, such as invalid, contradictory, or missing values.

### When to Panic

- The bad state is unexpected.
- The code relies on not being in a bad state.
- There’s no good way to encode this information in the types.

Returning an error allows the calling code to handle the situation, but when continuing could be insecure or harmful, it might be best to call `panic!`.

### When to Return Result

When failure is expected, return a `Result`. This includes situations like parsing malformed data or handling an HTTP request error. Use Rust’s type system to perform checks at compile time, such as ensuring a value is never negative by using unsigned integers.

## Creating Custom Types for Validation

Instead of validating values in every function, create a custom type that ensures valid values. This way, functions using the type can rely on its validity.

Example:
```rust
pub struct Guess {
    value: i32,
}

impl Guess {
    pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
        if value < 1 || value > 100 {
            panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {value}.");
        }
        Guess { value }
    }

    pub fn value(&self) -> i32 {
        self.value
    }
}
```

This approach ensures that all instances of `Guess` are valid, reducing the need for repeated validation checks.

## Summary

Rust’s error handling features help write robust code. Use the `panic!` macro for unrecoverable errors and the `Result` enum for recoverable errors. Deciding when to use each appropriately makes your code more reliable.
