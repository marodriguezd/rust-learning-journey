# Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

As you write large programs, organizing your code becomes increasingly important. Grouping related functionality and separating distinct features clarifies where to find and change specific parts of your code.

## Organizing Code

Initially, programs are written in one module in one file. As projects grow, you should split code into multiple modules and files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate. For larger projects, extract parts into separate crates, becoming external dependencies. For interrelated packages that evolve together, Cargo provides workspaces.

## Encapsulation and Scope

Encapsulating implementation details allows code reuse at a higher level. Public interfaces enable other code to call your code without knowing the implementation. This limits the amount of detail to remember.

### Scope

Scope defines the context where names are defined as "in scope." It determines whether a name refers to a variable, function, struct, enum, module, constant, or other item. Rust allows creating scopes and managing which names are in or out of scope, preventing name conflicts.

## Rust's Module System

Rust's module system manages code organization, exposure of details, privacy, and scope of names in programs. Key features include:

- **Packages**: A Cargo feature to build, test, and share crates.
- **Crates**: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable.
- **Modules and use**: Control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths.
- **Paths**: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module.

## Summary

In this chapter, weâ€™ll cover these features, discuss their interactions, and explain how to use them to manage scope. By the end, you'll understand the module system and be able to work with scopes effectively!
